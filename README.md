# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Created by deeplearning.py


## Introduction

This my programming assignments for this speciazation. Because I cannot access to the courses which are ended, I foked Kulbear's work for Course 1-3 and add my assignments for course 4 Convolutional Neural Networks and course 5 Sequence Models. To notice, some small changes in code may exist because they are still update the assignments. 

All the rights belongs to [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera(https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
